Our project aims to reduce garbage from pilling up around dustbins and stop the overflowing of bins. Heaps of garbage, if allowed to collect, can create big problems for the public such as:
	1.	Soil contamination by seeping into the soil.
	2. 	Air pollution through harmful fumes being released.
	3.	Threat to animals such as cows eating plastic bags.
	4.	Contamination of water bodies if garbage is washed into them.
	5.	Being a fire hazard.
	6.	Spreading diseases through insects such as flies and mosquitos.

We also aim to help garbage collection workers and cleaners as they are the ones who are required to pick up and clean the scattered overflowing garbage. Garbage collection is said to be a hazardous job with dangers such as cuts from sharp objects and exposure to bacteria and toxics. We hope we can make their job a bit more safer and easier.
